 using

 , we can reach all the way from a http request, down to the unix shell, and back, essentially making thousands and thousands of programs compatible:

   bash(‘whoami’);

 if you’ve ever listened to
 <a href="http://music.princeton.edu/~dmitri/A1randomnotes.mp3">truly randomly generated music</a>
 , you know that arbitrary-random sucks. It’s worthless, patronising.
</p>
<p>
 what doesn’t suck though is a
 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eC14GonZnU">non-predictable system</a>
 .
 <br/>
  here things are part of a story, though can’t be predicted.
</p>
<p>weather is nice because it is this sort of nice-random,  the variations we get from weather are meaningful, its part of our story from god.  it shouldn’t be ignored.</p>
<p>so if it’s super-cold outside, it should be kind-of cold inside.</p>
<p>if it’s dark, or low-pressure, or humid, you should feel it… just less.</p>
<p>
 a weather-responsive thermostat could be a
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">pid controller</a>
  whose set-point is generated in proportion to input error.

<strong>yes.</strong>
<br/> its not just
<a href="http://www.break.com/usercontent/2007/10/Will-Ferrell-writes-a-song-for-garth-brooks-384390.html">a joke about bad folk-singers</a> running out of songs. We are nearing the end of possible valid pop songs. We have composed most of the genre.
<p>
 <strong>Description</strong>
 <br/>
  We pretend we break all the rules musically, but without a grammar, sound is noise. Music = sound + structure. Music is
 <em>sound that means something</em>
 . Without a genre (the rules), music doesn’t happen. So inside a genre, we can validly permute all possible combinations. Pop music I believe, is a very strict genre.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>melody length</strong>
 <br/>
  There are 12 notes. But a song uses a specific key, which has 8 notes.
 <br/>
  Accidentals in pop music are sometimes allowed, in varying degrees.
</p>
<p>A pop melody is either 4 or 8 bars long, in 4/4 time. A pop-music melody is always either 16 or 32 beats.</p>
<p>How many melody-relevant notes can squeeze into 32 beats? anything faster than a 16th note is definetly melody-irrelevant. 16ths are often used in pop… but a full 64 (4x4x4) note melody is ridiculous.</p>
<p>
 bad electronic music has 3 note melodies.
 <br/>
  Luckily, the lower-limit is irrelevant. There are only 256 possible 2-note melodies. and 1 1-note melody. Lets include them.
</p>
<p>
 The number of notes in a melody is quite flexible.
 <br/>
  A melody really occupies a large amount of the surrounding melody-space.
 <br/>
  If I take ‘yellow submarine’ and add a 3-note trill, like people on american idol always do, its still yellow submarine.
 <br/>
  You can also skip notes and still recognize it.
 <br/>
  Even
 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYQKS9-Is0">super-polysylabic songs from quebec</a>
  can be reduced to 4 notes or so and still be recognizable.
 <br/>
  So this becomes tricky.
</p>
<p>
 Experimenting in my head..
 <br/>
  can you feel the love tonight = 22 – 36
 <br/>
  freak by radiohead 15 – 25
</p>
<p>
 <strong>Chorus and verse</strong>
 <br/>
  there is no original content in a pop-music verse. It is determined by the chorus.
 <br/>
  i’d love to make a program that created verses from choruses.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>Musicality</strong>
 <br/>
  the number of possible songs increases at an exponential with the length of the melody,
 <br/>
  8^8 = 16 million
 <br/>
  16^8=4294 million
 <br/>
  but the musical requirements of the melody also increase exponentially with the length of the melody.
</p>
<p>
 If you have a 32 note melody, the final 16 notes are pretty much completely determined by the first 16.
 <br/>
  so even if there is a trillion possible 32 note melodies, there are no new melodies offered by the 32nd note.
 <br/>
  You can’t take add a G flat to the end of ‘Moon River’.
 <br/>
  And given that new valid melodies take up such a large ‘melody-space’, I think you’ll find that the curve flattens out at 9 or 10 notes. I’ll say all 3 note-melodies are valid and new, half of 8 note melodies are valid and new, and no 10 note melodies are valid and new.
 <br/>
  This is, I think, generous.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  <br/>
   I think there are about 20 million possible pop songs.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>Law and Existing songs</strong>
 <br/>
  the
 <a href="http://freebase.com/view/authority/musicbrainz">musicbrainz</a>
  database has 9 million songs
</p>
<p>
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Kahle">Brewster_Kahle</a>
  believes there are
 <a href="http://fora.tv/2009/12/06/Brewster_Kahle_Universal_Access_to_All_Knowledge">about 2 million different albums</a>
 , so yes a bit less than 20 million recorded songs in existence. Subtract non-pop genres, and covers, and you will have somewhere between 9 and 15 million ‘legally different’ pop songs.
</p>
<p>so from that estimate, yes, we are more than half-way done. And have probably already gotten the good ones.</p> ]]> http://spencerwaterbed.com/blog/2010/11/pop-music-permutation/feed/ 1   http://spencerwaterbed.com/blog/2010/11/how-does-a-tree-work/ http://spencerwaterbed.com/blog/2010/11/how-does-a-tree-work/#comments Mon, 22 Nov 2010 00:37:25 +0000 admin

<br/>
<img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Fractal-plant.svg"/>
<p>but how? we don’t really know.</p>
<p>
 what’s the actual mechanism for this?
 <br/>
  In idealised l-system trees, the next branch is only determined by its parent branch- say, half its length.
 <br/>
  the parent branch decides all of the variables for the child.
</p>
<p>
 but is that how trees actually work?
 <br/>
 <img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/1nT6a.jpg"/>
 <br/>
  not really.
</p>
<p>
 is the decision mechanism through competition? Branches try their best to get sunlight. The branch that gets sunlight will grow bigger, investing its resources in child branches, trying to get more sunlight.
 <br/>
  Is that it?
 <br/>
  I don’t think so. One thing that never happens is trees falling over because unbalanced growth. There is, in some way, ‘global’ decision making in the tree. There has to be. The tree chooses responsibly. There is (somehow) central processing with targeted signalling. If there wasn’t, wouldn’t there be enough apples on a branch to snap it?
</p>
<p>each branch communicates with the trunk – and as well, co-operates to share resources with siblings, children. A branch, if it grows a centimetre, requires every preceding branch to become stronger, and also commit more resources. Like how does a tree distribute its sugar etc? Evenly? But some branches grow faster than others. These decisions have to be made somewhere.</p>
<p>
 some interesting things are known about
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_growth_substance">plant growth hormones</a>
 . but not enough.
</p>
<p>
 Buds
 <a href="http://vimeo.com/10984172">that know they’re at the top</a>
  inhibit new buds on parent branches.
</p>
<p>I don’t think we’ve found the decision process, the ‘l-system mechanism’ yet.</p>

 you may recognize it.
</p>
<p>it is found in the dewey decimal system, your computer file-system, wikipedia categories, wordnet, opencyc, SKOS,  DMOZ, book indexes, animal classification, government committees…</p>
<p>
 it is called a taxonomy, phylogeny, hierarchy, ‘directed acrylic graph’, subclass system, tree diagram.
 <br/>
 <strong>
  <br/>
   The principle is this:
 </strong>
</p>
<p>if you want to organise pictures of your cat – put information about individual pictures in a way that the information can be put in, and taken out, in a useful way-</p>
<p>you could make a network of folders:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>cat outside->cat in the sun->cat lying down->cat lying down in grass->cat lying down on the front lawn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>there’s a system that captures two things: what the cat is doing, and location.</p>
<p>consider the alternate, parallel network:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>‘cat awake’->’cat eating’->cat eating vegetables->cat eating strawberries</p>
</blockquote>
<p>these two networks are consistent with one another, and  if he’s in the front lawn eating strawberries, both can be used. In fact, every piece of information in the image can be classified by a phylogeny.</p>
<ul>
 <li>‘cat with 2 other brown cats’</li>
 <li>‘cat at 12 years old’</li>
 <li> ‘cat looking away from the camera’</li>
 <li>‘cat under incandescent lighting’</li>
 <li>‘cat on tuesday’</li>
 <li>‘cat watching seinfeld’</li>
</ul>
<p>and these variables can be sorted properly: ‘cat during the week’,  ‘cat watching american television’, ‘cat under non-oxidative lighting implement’.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
 <img alt="wikipedia politics category, only 4 layers deep" src="http://www.chrisharrison.net/projects/wikiviz/small/politicsb15025010k3pS.jpg" class="aligncenter"/>
</p>
<p>
 the point is, that ALL information can be put into this ontology.
 <br/>
 <strong>but taking it out is impossible.</strong>
</p>
<p>
 go ahead and type
 <a href="http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?q=%22wikipedia%20categories%22">wikipedia categories in scholar.</a>
  you will see the tragedy as it has unfolded all over peoples unfortunate careers.
</p>
<p>When you go to take  the data out, its total fucking mess.</p>
<p>
 Wikipedia categories are so upset, they’re
 <em>recursive</em>
 . You follow one down the branch and end up where you began. It happens all over the place.
</p>
<p>
 For example, when
 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/About" title="DBpedia">dbpedia</a>
  classified articles based on
 <em>category intersection</em>
 , it was extremely poor accuracy. ‘
 <strong>Category:Eurovision contestants</strong>
 ‘ includes a book about them, even though you can eventually reach up to ‘
 <strong>category:person</strong>
 ‘.
</p>
<p>
 few things are more hilarious (and depressing) than wikipedia’s daily
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion">categories for discussion</a>
 . everyone is such a philosopher. They (with great patience) pull each others hair over a system that seems to constantly demand it.  That’s what it means to chose the wrong ontology. If your information never seems to fit easily, it’s cause the ontology is wrong.
</p>
<p>
 When the well-meaning wikipedia editor makes the category  “
 <strong>Category: tennis players that have lost 5 games</strong>
 “, or “
 <strong>Category: Gothic people</strong>
 ” they are the victim of bad ontology design.
</p>
<p>You see the exact same thing happening with websites encouraging people to ‘tag’ freely, in a folksy phylogeny. This information can never be pulled out of it at any depth.</p>
<p>the reason is that the predicates remain completely unrepresented. Or rather, all of the information about the category is still unstructured, it’s simply still in the text, in the known assumptions regarding the subject, and in the context of the other categories. You never actually put your information in.</p>
<p>when you have a category about cat actions, and a category about time of day, the thing that you’re actually representing with the phylogeny is a shallow agreement. a folksonomy. its not data. you’re not putting the actual data into a system. Unfortunately, you’re flattening all the data into one relation- ‘contains’, or ‘included in’.</p>
<p>
 <strong>The properties need to be explicitly stated.</strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>Explicit properties look like this:</strong>
 Subject – verb – object
</p>
<p>Mark Keil    -  /freebase/tennis/matches_lost    –    5</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Marilyn Manson   -   /dbpedia/musician/genre   -  goth</p>
<p>if you have disciplined predicates like this, you are actually putting your data in, and can take it back out.</p>
<p>
 <strong>This is why the semantic web is not hype.</strong>
  We have finally figured out how to organize information.
 <br/>
  In 10,000 years, we will still be organizing our information as triples. It’s how information works, and we’ve figured it out.

</p>
<p>its really the most inefficient process you could ever imagine. It’s not futuristic, it’s not low-tech because computers are slow, its just inefficient. Insane.</p>
<p>
 <a href="http://twit.tv/fib55/">Rahul Sarpeshkar gives a hilariously good description</a>
  of the state of affairs of digital->analogue computing, and how we’ve collectively forgotten that information can exist physically. He’s building machines that do most of their processing before the processor. They don’t get faster every 18 months, because they don’t need to.

</p>
<p>So if Wired magazine got us hooked on [adc], what can we learn as we rebound?</p>
<p>which digitizations should we ditch?</p>
<p>consider the cell-as-computer analogy, which considers base-pairs as bits, and proteins as their expressions.</p>
<p>it was decided a few decades ago that methylated cytosine, is ‘C’. Exactly one piece of information. abstracting away effects of</p>
<p>ph gradients, topology, boyancy, plasticity, refraction of light, viscosity, availability of resources, electrical conductivity.</p>
<p>Is that cool?</p>
<p>If you reduce something too hard, what you will get is partial patterns, disconnected correlations. Hints of something going on.</p>
<p>it’s becoming more and more clear that this sort of reduction in genetics is too aggressive. We still know jack shit about genetics.</p>
<p>
 Consider a mad cow disease, which is
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion">
  <em>just a shape</em>
 </a>
 , with no genetics at all.
</p>
<p>
 a shape is a function with an obscene set of conditional statements, and recursion, and emergence,
 <a href="http://twit.tv/fib57">adaptation and inheritence</a>
 . It’s really not something that makes much sense to compute digitally.
</p>
<p>
 - as Steve Talbot describes in his recent paper,
 <a href="http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/getting-over-the-code-delusion">“everything does everything to everything”</a>
</p>
<p>given the success of the [analogue - digital - analogue] engineering strategy over my lifetime, its easy to push on this analogy. but its just not actually that useful.</p>

I mean, if someone says, you know, “What was it like up there?” You know, I’ve just written this fucking book telling em four hundred pages of what it was really like up there, and they say “oh i loved your book! Now tell me: What was it really like up there?” Well , I learned to deflect that. It depends on their age. I mean, if it’s a young kid, you just say, “Oh it was cool, man.” They say, “Was it?”    “Oh, shit, yeah. Oh, it was cool.” And they walk off; that’s great. It’s they want to hear the sound of their own voice, or they want to somehow interject with their own question or their own inquiry into the process. And that’s alright. So I go by the age; I usually give em a one- or two word answer, depending how old they are. And they usually – sometimes, though, they won’t be satisfied with that, and they’ll want to go on. But nine times out of ten, they’ll say, “Oh, oh, uh-huh.” And they’re very pleased.</p>

  alert() sucks, makes you click ‘ok’, and feels like windows2k.

Websites should alert users of changes gracefully, using one always-on-top ‘growl’ standard.

   opensearch result standard
 </strong>
 <br/>
 <a href="http://freebase.com/view/en/opensearch">opensearch</a>
  is, I think, the least-taken advantage of standard in webprogramming. It has HUge potential for making websites very well-integrated. It lets you query disparate websites using a single open-standard, but despite this initial cooperation, results of each page need to be scraped ad-hoc. If we call something using an open standard, it should respond in an open standard.

 <strong>fullscreen api</strong>
 <br/>
  fullscreen is awesome, and its all the ‘features’ of web apps that make it difficult to concentrate on the internet. you should be able to fullscreen anything. use your computer screen how you want.
 <br/>
  Browsers render html according to screensize, but that bit’s hidden.
 <br/>
  fullscreen is always lame with the web, cause theres no easy way to do it.
